# Scheduling

The `schedule` command (parsed by `parseScheduleCommand` in `src/schedule.ts`, dispatched by `src/commands/schedule.ts`) queues commands to run later in a tab — the issuing agent's tab by default, or another tab named with an `in <tab>` clause. Each tab owns its schedule; agent entries are stored in the `schedule` array of the agent's state file (`.janissary/state/<name>.json`) and survive `--relaunch`. Harness tabs can hold schedules too, but theirs live in memory only (harness tabs have no persisted agent state) and end when the tab closes.

### Schedule forms

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schedule at <time> <cmd>` | One-shot at a clock time today, or the next day if that time has already passed. |
| `schedule on <date> [at <time>] <cmd>` | One-shot at a calendar date; the time defaults to 9:00am when omitted; rolls to next year if the date has passed. |
| `schedule every <N><m\|h\|d\|w> <cmd>` | Recurring at a fixed interval (minutes/hours/days/weeks); first run is one interval from now. |
| `schedule every day at <time> <cmd>` | Recurring every day at a clock time. |
| `schedule every <weekday> at <time> <cmd>` | Recurring on a named weekday (`monday`…`sunday`) at a clock time. |

Times accept `3:35pm`, `2pm`, or 24-hour `14:00`; dates accept `august 12th`, `aug 12`, or `8/12` (month names match by ≥3-character prefix). The first token after `schedule` (unless it is the reserved `list`, `cancel`, or `clear`) is the timer's name, which becomes the entry's id — so it appears in the schedule window and `schedule cancel <name>` works — and the remainder is the schedule form. A duplicate name within a tab is rejected; a name with no valid following schedule form returns the `Usage:` message.

### Targeting another tab

An optional `in <tab>` clause immediately after the timer name (`schedule NAME in TAB <form> COMMAND`) attaches the entry to the named tab instead of the issuing tab. The entry is stored under the target tab's label, so it appears in *that* tab's schedule window and view, persists in *that* agent's state file, and fires in *that* tab — the issuing tab only records the confirmation message (`Scheduled <name> in <tab>: …`). Valid targets are agent tabs and harness tabs; image/page/markdown views are rejected with `Tab "<label>" cannot run scheduled commands.`, and a missing tab with `No tab named "<label>".` Duplicate-name checks apply within the target tab. Tab-completion (`completeScheduleTarget` in `src/completion-handlers.ts`) completes the label after `in` against all open tab labels.

### Management

`schedule list` prints the agent's entries (`<name>  <spec>  (next: <when>)  <command>`), or `No scheduled commands.` when empty. `schedule cancel <name>` removes one entry (reporting `No scheduled command "<name>".` if absent). `schedule clear` removes all entries for the agent. Each management form accepts a trailing `in <tab>` to operate on another tab's schedule (`schedule list in claude`, `schedule cancel standup in claude`, `schedule clear in claude`) — the only way to manage a harness tab's timers, since harnesses cannot run commands. A malformed invocation returns a `Usage:` message and does not modify the schedule.

### Firing

A single one-second interval (`ScheduleManager` in `src/schedule-manager.ts`) drives all tabs. On each tick, for every **open** tab, entries whose `nextRun` is at or before now are fired; delivery depends on the tab's kind. In an agent tab, `<command> ## scheduled ##` is dispatched through the normal command handler targeted at that tab, so the command runs and is recorded exactly as if typed there. In a harness tab, the raw command is typed into the harness PTY as a line of input (`ptyInput(harness.ptyId, command + '\r')`, like `send`); if the harness is not running yet (or has exited), the entry stays due and delivery retries on a later tick. After a firing, a one-shot entry is removed; a recurring entry's `nextRun` is advanced (`computeNextRun`: interval → now + interval; clock time → next matching occurrence). After any schedule change in a tick, the state is re-emitted so the schedule window in the web UI updates to show the new next-run times. A firing for an agent that is not currently open as a tab is skipped, leaving the entry in the state file to fire the next time that agent is open and due. A firing into an agent tab that is currently busy queues behind the tab's other queued commands instead of running concurrently (see [[agent-command-queue]]).

### Schedule window

While the active agent has at least one scheduled entry, a small titled `schedule` window (`ScheduleWindow` in `src/ScheduleWindow.tsx`) floats at the top-right, stacked directly below the connection window (its `top` offset is computed in `src/cli.tsx` from the connection window's rendered height). It lists one line per timer — `<id>  <spec>  (next: <when>)` — with recurring timers drawn in the accent color and one-shots in the foreground color. The window is hidden whenever the active agent's schedule is empty. Its body lines are produced by the pure `scheduleLines` helper, mirroring `ConnectionWindow`'s `statusLines`.

In the web app the same panels are `StatusPanels` (`web/src/StatusPanels.tsx`). On a harness tab the schedule panel floats over the top-right of the harness terminal (rendered `scheduleOnly` — no connections panel, since the whole tab is the terminal connection), with pointer events disabled so it never intercepts terminal input.

### Scheduling tab

The `schedules` command (plural, distinct from the singular `schedule` command that manages a tab's own timers) opens a singleton, view-only tab labeled "schedules" that aggregates every scheduled command across all open tabs into one list. Where the schedule window shows only the active tab's timers, this tab collects the entries from every tab that can hold a schedule — agent tabs and harness tabs alike — into a single flat list ordered soonest-to-run first, regardless of which tab owns each entry. A second `schedules` reuses the existing tab rather than opening another.

`schedules left` and `schedules right` dock the tab into that sidebar; bare `schedules` on a docked tab undocks it back to the center. Docking follows the same behavior as the notifications tab, including its dock-cycle button: while docked, the tab's own header carries a button that cycles it left↔right, styled and placed the same way as the file navigator's and notifications tab's own dock-cycle buttons. The header and its dock-cycle button stay present even when the tab has no scheduled entries — an empty, docked schedules tab can still be cycled left↔right. The tab is view-only: unlike an agent or harness tab it has no command bar and no transcript beneath it.

The tab has two renderings of the same data, both laid out as a numbered table with column headings — `#`, `Owner`, `Id`, `Next`, `Spec`, `Command` in the main application area, `#`, `Next`, `Id`, `Owner` when docked. In the main application area it shows one row per entry with the owning tab, the timer name, the next-run time, the schedule spec, and the command to run; recurring entries are distinguished from one-shots by an accent color, matching the schedule window. When docked into a sidebar it shows a compressed one line per entry — the next-run time (time of day only, with the date omitted since the column is narrow), the timer name, and the owning tab — omitting the command and spec. Both renderings stay ordered next-to-run first and number their rows `1)`, `2)`, `3)`, … from the top.

The list is live: it is recomputed as the scheduler ticks, so new schedules appear, fired one-shots drop off, and next-run times advance without any manual refresh. When no tab has a scheduled entry the tab shows "No scheduled commands." and stays open. Apart from selecting rows and the one direct action below, the content is read-only: a single click selects a row (highlighting it) without changing the active tab; a double click, or pressing Enter/Return on the selected row, switches to the tab that owns it. The Up and Down arrow keys move the selection one row at a time (Home/End jump to the first/last row), scrolling the list as needed to keep the selected row in view.

Pressing Backspace or Delete on the selected row opens a confirmation dialog titled `Delete schedule "<id>"?` with Delete and Cancel buttons. Confirming cancels that timer in its owning tab — removing the entry and, for agent tabs, persisting the change to the agent's state file so it does not return on relaunch, exactly as `schedule cancel <name>` does; harness entries are removed in memory only. The list refreshes immediately to drop the removed row. Cancelling the dialog (Escape, the Cancel button, or clicking outside) leaves the entry in place. This works in both the full and docked renderings. Creating, editing, or clearing a schedule stays on the `schedule` command in the owning tab. See the Schedule window section for the per-tab floating panel this tab complements.

### Authored schedules in a profile

A profile's harness entry can author its tab's schedule directly, without the tab existing yet: its `schedule` field is a list of strings in this same command grammar, minus the leading `schedule` keyword and the `in <tab>` clause (the tab is implicitly the entry's own, once opened). Its `run` field is a list of commands typed into the harness once, shortly after launch — each becomes a one-shot entry that fires on the first tick and then disappears from the schedule panel. A schedule string that fails to parse, or that includes an `in <tab>` clause, is reported in the launch output and skipped; a duplicate name within one entry keeps the first and reports the rest. See Profiles.

### Scheduling a harness launch with a prompt

Because launching a harness is an ordinary command, a `schedule` entry can wrap a `harness … with <prompt>` command to spin up a fresh harness and feed it an initial prompt at a future time — for example `schedule deploy at 5pm harness claude with fix the failing tests`. When the schedule fires, the launch runs like any typed command: a new harness tab opens and its `with` prompt is injected once the harness is running, using the same one-shot mechanism a profile's `run` entry uses (see [[harness]]). The scheduler's ` ## scheduled ##` marker applies only to the launch command dispatched into the issuing tab; the injected prompt itself is delivered verbatim, with no marker. The intended forms are immediate and one-shot at a future time — a recurring schedule that would spawn a new harness on each firing is out of scope.

### `schedule` command

`schedule` queues a command for later execution in the issuing agent's tab, or in another tab via `in <tab>`. See the Scheduling section. Every scheduled command is named by the first token after `schedule`. Forms: `schedule <name> [in <tab>] at <time> <cmd>` (one-shot today/next day), `schedule <name> [in <tab>] on <date> [at <time>] <cmd>` (one-shot date), `schedule <name> [in <tab>] every <N><m|h|d|w> <cmd>` (recurring interval), `schedule <name> [in <tab>] every <day|weekday> at <time> <cmd>` (recurring clock time), plus `schedule list [in <tab>]`, `schedule cancel <name> [in <tab>]`, and `schedule clear [in <tab>]`. Malformed invocations return a `Usage:` message.

### New schedule dialog

In the web app, typing bare `schedule` (the word alone, with no arguments) opens a "New schedule" dialog instead of returning the `Usage:` message — mirroring how bare `harness` opens the "New harness" dialog. No transcript line is recorded for the bare keyword itself. The dialog is web-only; the terminal UI keeps returning the `Usage:` message for a bare `schedule`.

The dialog covers creation only, not managing existing entries — those stay on `schedule list/cancel/clear` and the schedule window. Its fields are: a timer name, a target tab (a dropdown of eligible tabs — agent and harness tabs only — defaulting to the current active tab), a schedule-type selector covering all five forms (`at <time>`, `on <date> [at <time>]`, `every N(m|h|d|w)`, `every day at <time>`, `every <weekday> at <time>`), the time/date/interval/weekday inputs for the selected type, and the command to run. The Schedule button stays disabled until the name, command, and the selected type's required inputs are filled in.

On submit, the dialog assembles the equivalent `schedule NAME [in TAB] <form> COMMAND` string (omitting the `in TAB` clause when the target is the active tab) and submits it through the normal `command` path, exactly as if it had been typed — so duplicate-name and parse errors surface as a transcript line in the target tab, the same as a typed command. Escape or the Cancel button closes the dialog without scheduling anything. Field values are remembered across reopens within the session (not persisted to disk).
