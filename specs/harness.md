# Harness Tab

A **harness tab** opens an AI coding harness (claude, opencode, or codex) as the entire tab body —
a live PTY terminal that takes over the tab in place of the usual transcript and command bar. An
**ssh tab** (opened via `ssh <destination>`) is a harness-view tab of the same shape, running a
real `ssh` session instead of an AI harness — see SSH Tab for its own command grammar, connections
row, and the one place its behavior differs (the connections panel is shown, not suppressed).

## Command

```
harness <name> [as <label>] [-w]
```

Valid names: `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`. The binary must be on `PATH`; if it is not found, the
PTY exits immediately and the tab closes (see [Lifecycle](#lifecycle)).

- `harness` with no name — error: `Usage: harness <claude|opencode|codex> [as <label>] [-w].`
- `harness foo` — error: `Unknown harness "foo". Choose from: claude, opencode, codex.`

Before the harness tab opens, the `harness <name> [as <label>] [-w]` command itself is recorded
in the **creator's** transcript — the tab `harness` was run from, not the new harness tab (which
has no transcript of its own). This happens synchronously ahead of the PTY spawn, so the launch
is always visible even if the harness exits — and its tab closes — immediately after.

### Custom tab label (`as <label>`)

By default a harness tab's label is the harness name (`claude`, `opencode`, `codex`), disambiguated
with `-2`, `-3`, … if that label is already in use. `as <label>` overrides this with an arbitrary
label instead, still disambiguated the same way if it collides with an existing tab:

```
harness opencode as quality   → tab "quality" running opencode
harness opencode as quality   → tab "quality-2" running opencode (label already taken)
```

The harness identity (`name`, the binary launched) is unaffected by `as` — only the tab's label
and title change. `as` and `-w`/`--workspace` may be combined in either order:

```
harness opencode as quality -w
```

- `harness claude as` (no label after `as`) — error: `Usage: harness <claude|opencode|codex> as <label>.`

### Workspace flag (`-w` / `--workspace`)

Adding `-w` (or `--workspace`) clones the root repository (detected from the current directory) into
a disposable workspace named after the harness tab's unique label, identically to `agent --workspace`:

```
harness claude -w    → tab "claude"   with workspace at .janissary/workspace/claude/
harness claude -w    → tab "claude-2" with workspace at .janissary/workspace/claude-2/
```

The harness PTY starts in the workspace directory. The workspace is removed when the tab is closed.
If no git repository is found from the current directory, an error is shown and no tab is created.
On macOS, the harness process is additionally confined to the workspace by a Seatbelt sandbox — see
[[sandbox]] and [[workspaced-agent]].

## Harness tab data

A harness tab is distinguished by `view: 'harness'` and carries a **harness payload**:

- **name** — the harness identifier (`claude`, `opencode`, or `codex`).
- **program** — the binary that was launched.
- **ptyId** — the live PTY stream id used by xterm.js to attach.
- **status** — `running` while the process is alive. The tab is closed as soon as the process
  exits, so `exited` is not observed in normal operation.
- **exitCode** — would be set alongside an `exited` status; unused in practice since the tab
  closes before it could be read.

## Layout

A harness tab has **no command bar and no transcript**. When the active tab is a harness view, the
app renders the tab strip above a full-body terminal. Every other tab renders unchanged. Tab
switching continues to work via the tab strip or the Shift+←/→ chord.

## Focus

The xterm terminal is focused automatically in two cases:

- **On mount** — when the harness tab is first created, `term.focus()` is called so the terminal
  is ready for input immediately.
- **On tab switch** — when switching to a harness tab (via Shift+←/→, a tab-strip click, or
  `next`), the app focuses the harness terminal instead of the command-line input. Typing starts
  reaching the harness without any click.

Switching away from a harness tab restores the normal focus model (command-line input for agent
tabs; no special focus for image/page tabs).

## Input model

All keys, clicks, and mouse events are delivered to the harness **except**:

- **Shift+←/→** — the tab-switch chord, which bubbles to the window handler.
- Clicks on the tab strip — handled by the tab strip as usual.

Ctrl-combinations (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+R`, `Ctrl+Z`, etc.) are sent to the harness.
Reorder/collapse chords (`Ctrl+←/→`, `Ctrl+T`) are **not** available while a harness is focused;
switch to another tab first.

**Shift+Enter** is translated before it reaches the PTY: instead of a bare carriage return
(which would submit), the terminal sends `ESC` + `CR` — the same sequence Alt/Option+Enter
produces in native terminals — which harnesses like claude read as a line continuation. This lets
multi-line prompts be composed in the harness without any harness-side terminal setup. This
applies to every xterm.js terminal in the app (harness tabs, interactive PTY takeover, terminal
cards).

## Tab strip

The tab's name in the strip is the tab's unique label — the harness name by default (`claude`,
`claude-2`, `claude-3`, …) or the custom `as <label>` if one was given — with no type marker
appended (per [[tab-label-no-markers]]). A **× close button** is shown in the strip (identical to
image/page view tabs). The tab's dot shows as **busy** for as long as the harness process is
alive — it does not distinguish the harness actively working from the harness idling at its own
prompt, only "a harness process is running here" from "no harness process is running."

## Lifecycle

- **Created** by `harness <name>` — the command is first recorded in the creator's transcript,
  then a new tab is opened, focused, and the PTY starts.
- **Running** — the harness receives all input; the connections panel lists `terminal:<name>`.
- **Closed** — the tab closes as soon as the harness process exits, whether from the harness
  quitting normally, crashing, or the binary not being found on `PATH`. The tab's × button or
  `close` command closes it the same way while the process is still running (killing the PTY
  first). If the harness tab is the last remaining tab, closing it — including the harness
  process exiting on its own — quits the app (see `tabs.md`). There is no frozen "exited" state
  to inspect — the harness's own scrollback is gone once its tab closes.

## Placement and grouping

A harness tab is created adjacent to the active tab's group (same group number and bar color), like
an image or page view tab. It participates in tab reordering and grouping as any ordinary tab would.
A harness tab opened by `profile launch` instead joins the profile's own group (see Profiles).

## Persistence

Harness tabs are **live and in-memory** — they are not saved to agent state and are not restored on
`--relaunch`. Each launch starts fresh. A schedule attached to a harness tab (directly, or via a
profile's authored `schedule`/`run` entries — see Profiles) is memory-only for the same reason: it
ends when the harness's PTY exits and its tab closes (see Lifecycle above and Scheduling § Firing).

## Connections panel

While running, the harness PTY appears in the connections panel as `terminal:<name>`.

## Launching with a model (`profile launch`)

`profile launch <name>` can open a harness tab with a model selected, passed to the harness binary's
`--model` flag verbatim (currently only opencode's model catalog is populated). This is not available
from the interactive `harness <name>` command — see Profiles for the harness-entry schema.
