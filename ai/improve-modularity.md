# Improve Code Modularity (one safe extraction per run)

Your job: make **one** small, safe change that lowers the complexity of **one** high-complexity file by **moving a cohesive group of its code out into a new, focused module file** — then prove you did not break anything. Do exactly one extraction, then verify.

This is the **only** way we reduce a file's size and complexity here: extract a cohesive group of related code into a new file and import it back. Never compact code, strip comments, or delete blank lines to shrink a file — that hurts readability without improving the design (see [`CODE_GUIDELINES.md`](../CODE_GUIDELINES.md)).

Refactoring edits real code, so the rule is simple: **the tests must pass before you start and still pass after. If you cannot keep them passing, put the code back the way it was.**

Do the steps below **in order**. Do not skip steps. Do not invent your own process.

**Shell hygiene:** run every command on its own line — no `&&` chaining, no `; echo "Exit code: $?"` suffixes, no subshell captures. The exit code and output are visible in the tool result. To run a project script, always use `./scripts/run.mjs <name>` — never call `node scripts/<name>.mjs` directly.

**Run autonomously.** This task runs unattended — do not ask the user questions or wait for feedback at any step. Make the best judgment call yourself, using the rules in this document, and keep going. Only stop early if the project isn't green before you start (Step 1), or if every remaining candidate file is blocked (see "Blocked work" below).

## What you may and may not do

### Safe work — DO IT AUTOMATICALLY, never ask

When your plan is **only** safe work, you **must carry it out yourself, start to finish, without stopping.** Do **not** ask "Do you want me to proceed?". Do **not** pause to show the plan for approval. Do **not** wait for confirmation. Just make the change and verify it.

Safe work is exactly this: **extract one cohesive group of code from a high-complexity source file into one (or more) new module files you create, and import it back** — done by the Recipe in Step 5, and nothing else.

### Blocked work — skip and pick a different file

If doing the extraction would require any of the following, **go back to Step 3** and pick the next-best file instead. Never ask the user — just skip and move on.

1. Changing the **public API** of a file other files depend on — i.e. you cannot keep every existing `import` working. (If you move an `export`ed symbol but **re-export it from the original file** so no other file changes, that is still safe.)
2. Editing **more than 1 existing source file**, or changing import paths in more than 3 files (the new module file(s) you create do not count).
3. Touching **`src/controller.ts`** (the biggest, riskiest file) — even though it has the highest score.
4. Editing **any test file** (`*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`).
5. Touching **security, password/crypto, shell-execution, PTY/terminal, or network** code.

If every remaining candidate is blocked, report which files you considered and why each was blocked, and stop without changing any code.

> You may edit **only** the one existing source file you picked, plus the **new module file(s)** you create to receive the extracted code. Never edit `fta.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, or any other config or test file. Leave the `score_cap` in `fta.json` alone.

## Step 0 — Prepare the workspace

Execute `ai/prepare-workspace.md` in full before doing anything else.

---

## Step 1 — See the starting state (run these, write the numbers down)

Run all four and read the output:

```bash
npm run typecheck 2>&1
npm run lint 2>&1
npm run test 2>&1
npm run quality 2>&1
```

Then record these starting numbers — you will compare against them at the end. Put them straight into your report draft (Step 7):

- **TypeScript:** `npm run typecheck` must finish with **no errors**. If it errors before you touch anything, STOP and tell the user.
- **Lint:** near the end of `npm run lint` there is a summary line like `✖ 16 problems (0 errors, 16 warnings)`. Write down the **errors** count and the **warnings** count. Note especially any `max-lines` (file over 200 lines) and `sonarjs/cognitive-complexity` warnings — these point straight at extraction targets.
- **Tests:** they must be **green** (all passing). If any test is already failing **before** you touch anything, STOP and tell the user — do not start a refactor on a broken suite.
- **Quality (FTA):** `npm run quality` prints a table per area, sorted worst-first, with each file's **line count** and **FTA score** (lower = better). This is your **primary** signal for what to extract from. Write down the score and line count of the file you end up picking.

Always run these fresh. Do not trust earlier output in the conversation.

---

## Step 2 — Read the signals

You are looking for the file that most needs code moved out of it. Two places tell you:

- The **FTA table** (`npm run quality`): the top rows are the worst files. A high score usually means the file is both long and complex — a prime candidate to split.
- The **lint warnings** (`npm run lint`): a `max-lines` error means the file is over the 200-line limit and *must* shed code into a new module; a `sonarjs/cognitive-complexity` warning marks a function that has grown too tangled and often signals a cluster worth lifting out whole.

A `max-lines` or `cognitive-complexity` finding looks like this in the lint output:

```
src/foo.ts
  1:1   error    File has too many lines (243). Maximum allowed is 200  max-lines
  42:11 warning  Refactor this function to reduce its Cognitive Complexity
                 from 30 to the 15 allowed  sonarjs/cognitive-complexity
```

It tells you the **file** (and, for complexity, the **function line**) that is carrying too much.

---

## Step 3 — Pick exactly one file to extract from

1. From the FTA table, list the worst `src/` files together with any that carry a `max-lines` or `cognitive-complexity` warning.
2. **Cross out** any file that is:
   - a `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` file,
   - `src/main.ts`,
   - `src/controller.ts` (needs-permission — only with the user's go-ahead),
   - `src/pty.ts`, `src/shell.ts`, or any file whose main job is spawning processes, running a terminal, doing network
   - under `web/src/` (only consider these if no `src/` candidate is left),
   - already small and simple (low score, comfortably under 200 lines).
3. From what remains, pick the **one** file with the **highest FTA score** — that is the one most worth splitting. Prefer a file that is over (or near) the 200-line limit, since extraction there also clears a `max-lines` error.

State your pick in one short sentence: the file, its current FTA score and line count, and the warning(s) it carries. Write those numbers into your report draft.

---

## Step 4 — Plan the extraction (a quick note to yourself, then keep going)

Find **one cohesive group of code** to lift out whole — code that belongs together and reads naturally as its own module. Good clusters:

- a set of related pure helpers (e.g. all the parsing/formatting functions for one concern),
- the body and helpers of one over-complex function flagged by `cognitive-complexity`,
- a group of related types/constants plus the small functions that operate on them.

Jot a one- or two-line plan: **which** group of code you will move, the **name of the new file** (`kebab-case.ts`, focused on that concern), and **what the original file will import back** from it. This is a note for **you**, not a message to send — do **not** post it and wait for a reply.

Check the plan against **What you may and may not do**:

- If any of points 1–5 applies → go back to Step 3 and pick a different file.
- Otherwise (all safe work) → go straight to Step 5 and make the change **now, on your own, without asking.**

---

## Step 5 — Make the change

**First, back up the existing file you are about to edit**, so you can restore it exactly if anything goes wrong:

```bash
cp src/foo.ts src/foo.ts.bak
```

Then perform the extraction. Keep the diff focused — move the chosen group of code, and do not reformat or "tidy" unrelated lines.

### Recipe — extract a cohesive group into a new module file

1. **Create the new module file** next to the original, with a focused `kebab-case` name describing the concern (e.g. `src/foo-parsing.ts`). Keep it under 200 lines too — if the group you want to move is itself huge, move a smaller cohesive subset.
2. **Move the chosen code** (functions, and the types/constants only they use) into the new file. Add whatever `import`s that code needs at the top of the new file.
3. **Export** from the new file exactly the symbols the original file still needs.
4. **In the original file**, delete the moved code and add an `import { … } from './foo-parsing.js';` for the symbols you now call.
5. **Preserve the public API.** If any moved symbol was `export`ed and is imported by *other* files, **re-export it from the original file** (`export { thing } from './foo-parsing.js';`) so no other file has to change. If you cannot keep every existing import working without editing other files → STOP and ask (rule 1).
6. Do **not** change behavior, call signatures, or what anything returns. Do **not** move code in a way that breaks ordering of side effects or shared module state.
7. If you cannot find a clean, self-contained group to move like this, do **not** force it — restore your backup, go back to Step 3, and pick a different file (or report that no safe extraction was available).

### Style

- Match nearby naming: `camelCase` functions, `PascalCase` types, `kebab-case` filenames.
- Relative imports use a **`.js`** extension even though the source is `.ts` (e.g. `import { x } from './foo.js'`). The new module file and the import that points to it must both follow this.
- Add a comment only if the *why* is non-obvious; never a comment that just restates *what* the code does.

---

## Step 6 — Verify (run in this order; fix or put it back)

```bash
npm run typecheck:diff 2>&1
npm run test:diff 2>&1
npm run lint:diff 2>&1
npm run quality 2>&1
```

Check each, in order:

1. **TypeScript is clean.** `npm run typecheck:diff` must have no errors. A type error here almost always means a moved symbol's type is missing an import in the new file, or a re-export was forgotten — fix it in your source files. If you cannot make it clean quickly, restore your backup and report.
2. **Tests pass.** If a test now fails: try a quick, obvious fix in your source files (do **not** edit the test). If it does not pass quickly, **restore your backup** (`cp src/foo.ts.bak src/foo.ts`, and delete the new module file(s) you added) and report what blocked you. Never edit a test to make it pass.
3. **Lint is no worse.** Look at the `✖ … problems (… errors, … warnings)` line again. **Errors must be 0** (if you were clearing a `max-lines` error, it should now be gone). **Warnings must be the same or fewer** than Step 1, never higher. If a new warning or error appeared — often a missing `.js` import extension, a now-unused import, or complexity that rode along into the new file — fix it in your source files. Never silence a warning with an `eslint-disable` comment.
4. **Quality improved.** The original file's FTA score and line count should be **lower** than Step 1. The new module file should land at a reasonable score and stay under 200 lines. If the original's score did not drop, the extraction was too small to matter — restore the backup and pick a more substantial group (or a different file).

When all three pass, **delete the backup file**: `rm src/foo.ts.bak`.

---

## Step 7 — Report

Give the user a short report in this exact shape:

```
Target file:      <path>
New module:       <path of the file you created>
Extraction:       <one sentence — e.g. "moved the 4 query-parsing helpers out of database.ts into database-parsing.ts">
FTA score:        <before> -> <after>   (lines: <before> -> <after>)
Lint problems:    <before> -> <after>   (errors: <before> -> <after>)
TypeScript:       clean / <errors, if any>
Tests:            all pass / <what failed>
```

Keep it brief. Done.
